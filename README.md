Vespolina - Symfony2 ecommerce
==============================

General Info
------------

The purpose of this project is to create an expandable Symfony2 based ecommerce platform, built on interchangeable bundles that can be used independently of Vespolina, all managed by a configurable workflow process and whenever possible, using established standards.

State of the Project
--------------------

Vespolina is in very early stages.  We are currently in the design phase and are gathering functional needs which you can find on the
[wiki][vespolina_wiki] .  We love to hear your comments on our current understanding of different ecommerce scenarios.  You can find more information on the wiki such as use cases and process flow diagrams.

We have a chat meeting every Thursday at 20h UTC

Requirements
------------

Symfony is only supported on PHP 5.3.2 and up. To check the compatibility of
your environment with Symfony, you can run the `web/check.php` script, bundled
with this sandbox.

Installation
------------

  1. Clone the git repository and move into that directory:

        $ git clone git@github.com:vespolina/vespolina.git
        $ cd vespolina/

  2. Initialize and update the submodules:

        $ git submodule update --init

  3. Setup file permissions:

        $ chmod a+w app/cache/ app/logs/
        $ chmod a+x app/console

Automated Tests
---------------

To run the automated test suite you must have [PHPUnit 3.5][phpunit]
installed, which is available on [GitHub][phpunit_github]. Once installed, run
the test suite using the `phpunit` command:

    $ cd app/
    $ phpunit

To customize PHPUnit configuration for your environment, copy
`app/phpunit.xml.dist` to `app/phpunit.xml` and add your
customization there.
